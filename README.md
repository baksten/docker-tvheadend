This Repo contains the patched Tvheadend version to enable descrambling of icam **without** the patched oscam version.

It is recommended to not use the patched oscam binary with this version of tvheadend.

The Docker images are based on [linuxserver/tvheadend](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-tvheadend)
